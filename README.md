## üîç Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze a relational database through SQL. Key concepts demonstrated include:

- Filtering and sorting with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregation with `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Relational analysis using `JOIN`s
- Use of **subqueries**
- Creating **views** for reusable analysis
- **Indexing** to improve query performance
- Handling missing data with `COALESCE`

---

## ‚úÖ Key Insights

- üì¶ Orders analyzed by status and revenue
- üí∞ Total revenue grouped by payment types
- üë§ Average revenue per customer calculated
- üîç Identified high-value customers using `HAVING`
- üõ†Ô∏è Indexes created to optimize frequent queries
- üìÜ Handled missing delivery dates gracefully

## üì∑ Screenshots

- A selection of query outputs is provided in the `SCREENSHOTS/` folder.
- Not all queries are included as screenshots, but every query has been tested and validated.
