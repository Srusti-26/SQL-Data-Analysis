## 🔍 Overview

The goal of this project is to explore and analyze a relational database through SQL. Key concepts demonstrated include:

- Filtering and sorting with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`
- Aggregation with `GROUP BY`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`
- Relational analysis using `JOIN`s
- Use of **subqueries**
- Creating **views** for reusable analysis
- **Indexing** to improve query performance
- Handling missing data with `COALESCE`
